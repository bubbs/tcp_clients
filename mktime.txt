SYNOPSIS
    int mktime(mapping values)
    int mktime(int *values)

DESCRIPTION
    Construct an integer time value that measures the number of seconds since
    00:00:00 01/Jan/1970 UTC from specified date values.

    The values argument must either be an integer array, like that returned by
    gmtime(E), or a mapping, like that returned by parse_time(SE).

    The returned integer is comparable with values given by time(E) and ltime(SE) functions.

EXAMPLE
    The following code should print '0's.
        write(( mktime(parse_time()) -time() ) +"\n");
        write(( mktime(gmtime()) -time() ) +"\n");
        write(( mktime(parse_time()) -mktime(gmtime()) ) +"\n");

SEE ALSO
    ctime(E), gmtime(E), localtime(E), parse_time(SE), query_zone_offset(SE), time(E), user_time(SE), utime(E)

HISTORY:
    Created as a side thought, but seemed good and useful not to be a simul efun, Bubbs, June/2004.
    mktime(int *) support added 02/Feb/2008.
